# Linked-List-Manipulation
This repository contains a Python implementation of various operations on singly linked lists.

## Features
### The code includes the following functions for singly linked list operations:
&#8226; printLL(head): Print the linked list from the given head node.
&#8226; length(head): Calculate the length of the linked list.
&#8226; insertIth(head, data, i): Insert a new node with the given data at the i-th position in the linked list.
&#8226; delete_node(head, pos): Delete a node at the specified position in the linked list.
&#8226; find_node(head, x): Find the position of a node with value x in the linked list.
&#8226; ithNode(head, i): Get the value of the node at the i-th position in the linked list.
&#8226; take_input(): Create a linked list from user-provided input.
&#8226; lastNodetoFirst(head, n): Move the last n nodes of the linked list to the beginning.
&#8226;removeDuplicate(head): Remove duplicates from a sorted linked list.
&#8226;reverse_linkedList(head): Reverse the linked list using iterative method.
&#8226;isPalindrome(head): Check if the linked list is a palindrome.
&#8226;reverse_recursion(head): Reverse the linked list using recursion.
&#8226; midpoint(head): Find the value of the midpoint node in the linked list.
&#8226; mergeTwoSortedLinkedLists(head1, head2): Merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.
